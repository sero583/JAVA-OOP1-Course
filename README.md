# Java OOP1 Course
Here are my documents for my Java OOP1 course stored.<br>
All subfolders should have compiled artifacts, including a README.md explaining how it works. I discontinued creating for each practice a repository and will hold them here with a subfolder structure.

## (Abstract) Usage
* First of all, download the JAR file or build your own artifacts
* Then go to the place, where the artifacts are with the console and enter this command:<br>
`java -jar <artifactName>.jar arguments...`
* e.g. for StupidLogin:
`java -jar StupidLogin.jar <string: username> <string: password>`
