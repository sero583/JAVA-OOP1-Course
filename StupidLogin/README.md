# StupidLogin

Probably the most insecure login in this universe, but hey; it works.

This folder contains two variants, the first variant with the Map and one with two symmetrical arrays.<br>
The JAR build in this folder uses the one with the map, anyway de-facto both variants do the same thing. If you really want to see it, you can compile the other build by yourself or test it on your environment.
## Usage syntax
`java -jar StupidLogin.jar <string: username> <string: password>`
